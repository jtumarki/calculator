==========

Extremely simple and ugly calculator. Made to learn the basics of Django. Note: to see the results of successive operations, press the equals sign!

To run: you must have Django 1.5 and Python installed. In the main homework2 folder, run from the command line: python manage.py runserver and go to localhost:8000 in your browser.
